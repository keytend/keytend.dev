Part of [configuration and operations](/kmip-server/docs/#configuration-and-operations).

The TTLV and HTTPS listeners share one TLS configuration (there is no
per-port policy), selected by `--tls-profile` (`KMIP_TLS_PROFILE`). Choose it
like this:

- **Use `modern`** (the default) unless a client cannot connect.
- If a client offers only ChaCha20-Poly1305, X25519 or finite-field DHE, use
  `mozilla-intermediate` (not allowed in FIPS mode).
- Use a `kmip-*` value only when you must offer a specific authentication
  suite of the KMIP Profiles documents. Each enables exactly the versions,
  suites and groups below, and OpenSSL refuses everything else.

## Policies

| Value | TLS | Server key | FIPS mode | Based on |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `modern` (default) | 1.2, 1.3 | any | allowed | Mozilla intermediate v5, restricted to FIPS-approved choices |
| `mozilla-intermediate` | 1.2, 1.3 | any | refused | Mozilla intermediate v5 as OpenSSL ships it |
| `kmip-2-basic` | 1.3 | any | refused | Profiles 2.0, 2.1, 3.0 Basic and HTTPS |
| `kmip-2-basic-tls12` | 1.2, 1.3 | RSA | refused | the same with the optional TLS 1.2 (legacy) |
| `kmip-1-tls12` | 1.2 | RSA | refused | Profiles 1.1–1.4 TLS 1.2 suite; 1.4 Basic and HTTPS (legacy) |
| `kmip-1-basic` | 1.0–1.2 | RSA | refused | Profiles 1.1–1.3 Basic; 1.3 HTTPS (legacy) |
| `kmip-1-suite-b-128` (alias `kmip-1-suite-b`) | 1.2 | ECDSA P-256 | allowed | Profiles 1.3/1.4 Suite B minLOS_128 |
| `kmip-1-suite-b-192` | 1.2 | ECDSA P-384 | allowed | Profiles 1.3/1.4 Suite B minLOS_192 |
| `kmip-3-quantum-safe` | 1.3 | any | refused | Profiles 3.0 draft Quantum Safe |

The server logs a warning at startup under the three legacy policies. Cipher
suites and groups:

- `modern`: TLS 1.2 ECDHE with AES-GCM (no DHE); TLS 1.3
  `TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256` and `TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`; groups secp256r1,
  secp384r1, secp521r1.
- `mozilla-intermediate`: ECDHE and DHE AEAD suites including
  ChaCha20-Poly1305, three TLS 1.3 suites; the library's default groups
  (X25519 first, FFDHE included).
- `kmip-2-basic`: `TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`, `TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256`;
  groups x25519, secp256r1, secp384r1.
- `kmip-2-basic-tls12`: as `kmip-2-basic`, plus TLS 1.2
  `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA384`, `TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256`,
  `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256` and `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256`.
- `kmip-1-tls12`: `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA256`,
  `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256`; no groups.
- `kmip-1-basic`: `TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA`; no groups.
- `kmip-1-suite-b-128`: `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`; secp256r1.
- `kmip-1-suite-b-192`: `TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`; secp384r1.
- `kmip-3-quantum-safe`: `TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`,
  `TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256`; groups X25519MLKEM768, SecP256r1MLKEM768,
  SecP384r1MLKEM1024.

`keytend-kmip-server tls-profiles` prints every list, with the Profiles
sections each policy is derived from, as JSON.

A policy whose mandatory suites need an RSA or ECDSA server certificate
refuses to start with another key type. No single policy satisfies every KMIP
edition: 1.1–1.3 Basic require TLS 1.0, 1.4 Basic forbids it, and 2.x Basic
requires TLS 1.3.

### Finite-field DHE

`modern` offers no DHE suite or FFDHE
group: DHE is FIPS-approved, but it lets an unauthenticated client make the
server run costly DH public-key checks (CVE-2024-41996). A client that offers
only DHE needs `mozilla-intermediate`. The server-to-client connector uses the
same lists as `modern`.

### Suite B

`kmip-1-suite-b-128` and `kmip-1-suite-b-192` use OpenSSL's
RFC 6460 Suite B mode. Both sides must authenticate with ECDSA certificates
with the digitalSignature key usage, on P-256 (minLOS_128) or P-384
(minLOS_192), signed with ECDSA and the matching hash; the server refuses to
start with a server certificate that cannot be sent under the policy. Mixed
suites, such as AES-128 with P-384, are refused.

### Legacy policies

`kmip-2-basic-tls12`, `kmip-1-tls12` and `kmip-1-basic` enable static-RSA key
exchange (no forward secrecy) and CBC suites, and `kmip-1-basic` also TLS 1.0
and 1.1; the server logs a warning at startup. Use them only for clients that cannot
use `kmip-2-basic` or `modern`. `kmip-1-basic` runs at OpenSSL security level 0 (TLS
1.0 needs it), then puts back the 112-bit key minimum, the refusal of SHA-1
and MD5 certificate signatures, and the same strength for TLS 1.2 handshake
signatures. TLS 1.0 and 1.1 handshake signatures are not covered.

### Quantum Safe

`kmip-3-quantum-safe` uses the hybrid ML-KEM groups of OpenSSL 3.5, which the
image and every supported native build have; the server refuses to start
under this policy with a library that lacks them.

## Limits

- The project has no pinned copy of the Profiles 1.0 document
  ([specification data](/kmip-server/docs/specs/)), so there is no 1.0 policy.
- 3DES, static DH/ECDH, PSK and DHE-DSS suites from the Profiles' optional
  lists are not offered; OpenSSL 3.5 cannot provide most of them.
- Startup checks each TLS 1.0–1.2 suite name and the groups against the
  linked library. It cannot see suites that a higher default security level
  would refuse during the handshake (static RSA at level 3 or above).
