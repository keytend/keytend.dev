Part of [getting started](/kmip-server/docs/#getting-started).

Run a local server with disposable test certificates, then create and fetch a
key: first with `curl` over HTTPS JSON, then with PyKMIP over binary KMIP.
Everything here is for evaluation; deployment beyond the local test setup is
in [deployment](/kmip-server/docs/deployment/).

Afterwards, [manual installation](/kmip-server/docs/manual-install/) shows each step of the
script by hand, how to
[change a setting](/kmip-server/docs/manual-install/#change-a-setting) and
[renew the test certificates](/kmip-server/docs/manual-install/#renew-the-test-certificates),
and running from source.

## Prerequisites

| Need | Version and notes |
| --- | --- |
| Host | Linux, amd64 or arm64 |
| Container engine | Podman, or Docker 23 or later |
| Tools | Git, bash or zsh, `curl` 7.71 or later, Python 3.8 or later (3.12 or later for the signed release), `openssl` from OpenSSL 1.1.1 or later (`openssl version`) |
| To build the image | Network access to `registry.access.redhat.com`, the UBI package repositories and crates.io; about 1.5 GB of disk. The first build takes a few minutes. |
| For the signed release | gpg (GnuPG 2.2 or later); about 240 MB of downloads from GitHub: the 91 MB release and, on Linux, the 146 MB pinned cosign |

- The build needs BuildKit, Docker's default from 23.
- Your user must be allowed to run containers (rootless Podman, or Docker's
  `docker` group); the container itself runs as your user.
- macOS is untested. To try it, put OpenSSL 3 first on the `PATH` (the system
  `openssl` is LibreSSL), and install cosign 3 for the signed release:
  `brew install openssl@3 cosign; export PATH="$(brew --prefix openssl@3)/bin:$PATH"`.

## Run the container

Get the source; run every later command from the checkout:

```sh title="Run the container"
git clone https://github.com/keytend/keytend-kmip-server
cd keytend-kmip-server
```

Then [build the image](#build-the-image) from the checkout, or
[load the signed release candidate](#use-the-signed-release-instead)
0.10.0-rc.1, which needs no build.

### Build the image

The `:dev` tag marks a local build. On amd64 (`uname -m` prints `x86_64`):

```sh title="Build the image"
docker build -t localhost/keytend-kmip-server:dev .
```

On arm64 (`uname -m` prints `aarch64` or `arm64`), with the arm64 base images:

```sh frame="code"
docker build --platform linux/arm64 \
  --build-arg UBI_BUILDER="$(sed -n 's/^ARG UBI_BUILDER_ARM64=//p' Dockerfile)" \
  --build-arg UBI_MICRO="$(sed -n 's/^ARG UBI_MICRO_ARM64=//p' Dockerfile)" \
  -t localhost/keytend-kmip-server:dev .
```

With Podman, or a `docker` command that is Podman (`docker --version` says
so), add `--format docker`; it keeps the image's health check, which the OCI
format has no field for:

```sh frame="code"
podman build --format docker -t localhost/keytend-kmip-server:dev .
```

### Use the signed release instead

[`scripts/verify_release.sh`](https://github.com/keytend/keytend-kmip-server/blob/d401f07cd6eb5cab69fc8a046418e784774fc609/scripts/verify_release.sh) downloads a
release into a new directory outside the checkout, checks the cosign
signature of its `SHA256SUMS` with the checkout's
[`signing/cosign.pub`](https://github.com/keytend/keytend-kmip-server/blob/d401f07cd6eb5cab69fc8a046418e784774fc609/signing/cosign.pub) and its OpenPGP signature,
then every digest, and only then loads the image for this host's
architecture, tagged with its version. [Verifying a release](/kmip-server/docs/release-signing/#verifying-a-release) shows
each step and the other ways to verify.

```sh title="Use the signed release instead"
scripts/verify_release.sh 0.10.0-rc.1
```

<div class="kt-output">

```text title="Output" wrap hangingIndent=2
Verified OK
pgp_verify: good signature by the Keytend release key: /tmp/tmp.Xa1b2C3d4E/release/SHA256SUMS
…
verified and loaded localhost/keytend-kmip-server:0.10.0-rc.1
release files: /tmp/tmp.Xa1b2C3d4E/release
next: IMAGE=localhost/keytend-kmip-server:0.10.0-rc.1 scripts/quick-start.sh
```

</div>

cosign also warns about the transparency log, which releases do not use. The
`next:` command starts the server ([start it](#start-it)).

### Start it

```sh title="Start it"
scripts/quick-start.sh
# the signed release: IMAGE=localhost/keytend-kmip-server:0.10.0-rc.1 scripts/quick-start.sh
```

<div class="kt-output">

```text title="Output" wrap hangingIndent=2
ready
next (bash or zsh): . examples/https/kmip.sh && kmip create.json | field ResultStatus
```

</div>

The script uses `docker`, or `podman` when there is no `docker`; with both
installed, run `DOCKER=podman scripts/quick-start.sh` to use Podman.

It writes disposable test certificates (valid for 7 days) and a new master
key under `.cache/`, then starts the container `keytend-kmip-server` on
`127.0.0.1` ports 5696 (binary KMIP), 5697 (HTTPS) and 8080 (health)
([what it runs](/kmip-server/docs/manual-install/#start-the-server)). The test policy lets
the `client` certificate call every operation; `unlisted` is trusted by the
CA but not in the policy. Never use this CA or policy outside a test.
`docker logs keytend-kmip-server` shows the server's log.

If another process holds one of those ports, the container does not start
and the error says `address already in use` (Podman) or
`port is already allocated` (Docker). `sudo ss -ltnp 'sport = :8080'` (or
`:5696`, `:5697`) names the process; stop it, since the script has no port
setting.

The script refuses to run again until you [clean up](#clean-up). A stopped
container (after `docker stop` or a reboot) starts again with
`docker start keytend-kmip-server`. After `docker rm`, or to apply a changed
setting, `scripts/quick-start.sh --restart` recreates the container and keeps
the certificates, master key, data and image.

## Make a request with curl

KMIP over HTTPS is a `POST` of one request message to `/kmip`, authenticated by
the client certificate.
[`examples/https/create.json`](https://github.com/keytend/keytend-kmip-server/blob/d401f07cd6eb5cab69fc8a046418e784774fc609/examples/https/create.json) is a KMIP 2.1
Create request for a 256-bit AES key (the format is in
[JSON, XML and HTTPS bindings](/kmip-server/docs/encodings/)). Send it with the test `client`
certificate:

```sh title="Make a request with curl"
P=.cache/dev-pki
curl -sS --cacert $P/ca.pem --cert $P/client.pem --key $P/client.key \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary @examples/https/create.json \
  https://localhost:5697/kmip | grep -oE '"(ResultStatus|UniqueIdentifier)"[^}]*'
```

<div class="kt-output">

```text title="Output" wrap hangingIndent=2
"ResultStatus","type":"Enumeration","value":"Success"
"UniqueIdentifier","type":"TextString","value":"e7d04ef6-0dca-4540-a188-402a5bce6917"
```

</div>

If `curl` fails the TLS handshake, the test certificates have probably expired
([renew them](/kmip-server/docs/manual-install/#renew-the-test-certificates)).

[`examples/https/kmip.sh`](https://github.com/keytend/keytend-kmip-server/blob/d401f07cd6eb5cab69fc8a046418e784774fc609/examples/https/kmip.sh) wraps that command in
shell functions (bash or zsh): `kmip FILE [NAME=VALUE …]` sends a request
file from that directory, filling in its `$NAME` placeholders, and
`field TAG` prints a value from the JSON response. Create another key and
keep its identifier:

```bash frame="code"
. examples/https/kmip.sh
R=$(kmip create.json)
field ResultStatus <<<"$R"
ID=$(field UniqueIdentifier <<<"$R"); echo "$ID"
```

<div class="kt-output">

```text title="Output" wrap hangingIndent=2
Success
3f2c9a4e-58b1-4f0e-9d7c-1a6b2e8d4c07
```

</div>

If the status is not `Success`, `field ResultReason <<<"$R"` and
`field ResultMessage <<<"$R"` say why. Fetch the key with Get
([`get.json`](https://github.com/keytend/keytend-kmip-server/blob/d401f07cd6eb5cab69fc8a046418e784774fc609/examples/https/get.json), with `$ID` where the identifier
goes); `pretty <<<"$R"` shows the whole response:

```bash frame="code"
R=$(kmip get.json ID="$ID")
field ResultStatus <<<"$R"
field KeyMaterial <<<"$R"
```

<div class="kt-output">

```text title="Output" wrap hangingIndent=2
Success
9e96ffb8c1d0a6e2…5395683f7
```

</div>

The 32 key bytes are the hex `KeyMaterial` value (shortened here).

Now send the Create with the `unlisted` certificate, which the CA trusts but
the policy does not list: TLS succeeds, and the server refuses the request.

```sh frame="code"
KMIP_CLIENT=unlisted kmip create.json | field ResultReason
```

<div class="kt-output">

```text title="Output" wrap hangingIndent=2
PermissionDenied
```

</div>

- Without a client certificate the TLS handshake fails.
- The script starts the server with `--text-encoding readable`
  (`KMIP_TEXT_ENCODING`). Without it the server answers in the default
  `compatible` forms, in which JSON enumerations are hex codes (`0x00000000`
  for Success).

XML, Locate, batches and AES-GCM Encrypt with the same functions are in
[HTTPS with JSON or XML](/kmip-server/docs/clients/https/).

## Make a request with a KMIP library

Most applications speak binary KMIP on port 5696 through a library. Install
[PyKMIP](https://github.com/OpenKMIP/PyKMIP) at the commit this project tests,
pinned in
[`examples/clients/python/requirements.txt`](https://github.com/keytend/keytend-kmip-server/blob/d401f07cd6eb5cab69fc8a046418e784774fc609/examples/clients/python/requirements.txt).
This needs Python's `venv` module (the `python3-venv` package on Debian and
Ubuntu), `git` and access to GitHub; offline, use the
[curl requests](#make-a-request-with-curl).

```sh title="Make a request with a KMIP library"
python3 -m venv .cache/pykmip
.cache/pykmip/bin/pip install -r examples/clients/python/requirements.txt
```

[`examples/clients/python/quickstart.py`](https://github.com/keytend/keytend-kmip-server/blob/d401f07cd6eb5cab69fc8a046418e784774fc609/examples/clients/python/quickstart.py)
creates, fetches and destroys a key:

```python
import os

from kmip.core import enums
from kmip.pie.client import ProxyKmipClient

PKI = os.environ.get("KMIP_PKI", ".cache/dev-pki")  # the quick start's test certificates
CLIENT = os.environ.get("KMIP_CLIENT", "client")    # the client certificate in PKI

with ProxyKmipClient(
    hostname="localhost", port=5696,
    cert=f"{PKI}/{CLIENT}.pem", key=f"{PKI}/{CLIENT}.key", ca=f"{PKI}/ca.pem",
    ssl_version="PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2", kmip_version=enums.KMIPVersion.KMIP_1_4,
) as client:
    uid = client.create(
        enums.CryptographicAlgorithm.AES, 256,
        cryptographic_usage_mask=[enums.CryptographicUsageMask.ENCRYPT,
                                  enums.CryptographicUsageMask.DECRYPT],
    )
    client.activate(uid)
    key = client.get(uid)
    print(f"created {uid}: {len(key.value)}-byte AES key")
    client.revoke(enums.RevocationReasonCode.CESSATION_OF_OPERATION, uid)
    client.destroy(uid)
    print(f"destroyed {uid}")
```

```sh frame="code"
.cache/pykmip/bin/python examples/clients/python/quickstart.py
```

<div class="kt-output">

```text title="Output" wrap hangingIndent=2
created 8813e065-0fbf-4766-8977-0ac32ce6a0a1: 32-byte AES key
destroyed 8813e065-0fbf-4766-8977-0ac32ce6a0a1
```

</div>

PyKMIP also prints a `Config file … not found` notice on standard error; it is
harmless. PyKMIP checks the server certificate against `ca` but not the
hostname, so trust only a CA that issues certificates for this server
([Python](/kmip-server/docs/clients/python/#connection-settings)). Go, Java, C, Rust, HTTPS
and more Python tasks are in the [client guide](/kmip-server/docs/clients/).

## Clean up

From the checkout:

```sh title="Clean up"
scripts/quick-start.sh --clean
rm -rf .cache/pykmip                 # the KMIP library example
git clean -ffdXq examples/clients    # downloads and builds of the client pages
```

<div class="kt-output">

```text title="Output" wrap hangingIndent=2
removed container keytend-kmip-server
removed .cache/container, .cache/dev-pki and .cache/dev-data
```

</div>

`--clean` removes the container started from this checkout,
`.cache/container`, `.cache/dev-pki` and `.cache/dev-data` (the store of a
server [run from source](/kmip-server/docs/manual-install/#run-from-source); stop that server
first). `git clean -ffdX` removes only files that Git ignores, here the
libkmip clone and the C build, the keytend-kmip clone or zip and its
signature, and the Rust build of the
[client pages](/kmip-server/docs/clients/#examples-by-language). The clones are Git
repositories, hence the second `-f`.

The images and downloads stay. To remove them too:

```sh frame="code"
docker rmi localhost/keytend-kmip-server:dev   # a local build
docker rmi localhost/keytend-kmip-server:0.10.0-rc.1   # the signed release (arm64: also …:0.10.0-rc.1-arm64)
docker builder prune   # the build cache of every build on this host (about 1.5 GB after this one)
```

`verify_release.sh` keeps its download (about 90 MB): remove the directory
above the `release files:` path it printed, such as
`rm -rf /tmp/tmp.Xa1b2C3d4E`. On Linux it also keeps the pinned cosign in
`.cache/bin` (`rm -rf .cache/bin`).

Next: [connect your client](/kmip-server/docs/clients/), [configure](/kmip-server/docs/configuration/),
[deploy](/kmip-server/docs/deployment/).
