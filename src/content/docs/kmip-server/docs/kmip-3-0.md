Part of the [feature reference](/kmip-server/docs/#feature-reference).

KMIP 3.0 is not a final OASIS standard. The server implements part of the
Committee Specification Draft 02 (CSD02) for experimentation, only when
started with `--experimental-v3`, and only for requests with protocol version
3.0. A later draft may change any of this. Which 3.0 operations exist is in
the [support matrix](/kmip-server/docs/support-matrix/).

## Message differences

- No Batch Count, Batch Order Option or Unique Batch Item ID.
- Unique Identifiers use the Identifier type; requests may use Reference and
  Name Reference ([attributes](/kmip-server/docs/attributes/#identifiers-and-batch-references)).
  Name is a Text String, and links are typed attributes.
- Revoke always compromises the object; Deactivate is a separate operation.
- Asynchronous processing follows the 2.x rules; a request item that expands
  into several results keeps one correlation value
  ([asynchronous requests](/kmip-server/docs/messages/#asynchronous-requests)).

## System objects

Users, Groups and credentials (Password, Device, One Time Password and Hashed
Password Credential; Object Types 11–16) are created per principal and are
invisible to every other principal and to the generic operations: Get,
Locate, Get Attributes and Destroy never reach them, and no operation returns
a verifier, seed or S1.

Create User, Create Group and Create Credential need the policy grant and a
verified administrator in the request header: a users-file user with
`"administrator": true` ([credentials](/kmip-server/docs/credentials/#users-file)).

Create User needs one Name (unique per principal and against users-file
names) and one to eight Credential Links. A user may link at most one of each
password-type credential.

| Credential | What Create Credential stores, and how it is verified |
| --- | --- |
| Password | Only a PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-256 verifier (600,000 iterations). Pre-salted password fields are not supported. |
| Device | Device identifiers plus exactly one Password Link to a Password Credential; a 3.0 Device credential authenticates when the identifiers match and the linked password verifies. |
| One Time Password | TOTP only, with a client-supplied seed of at least 128 bits; verified with the user's password as in [credentials](/kmip-server/docs/credentials/#one-time-password). |
| Hashed Password | SHA-256, SHA-384 or SHA-512; verified as in [credentials](/kmip-server/docs/credentials/#hashed-password). |
| Certificate | Stored, but does not authenticate. |

System Objects belong to the principal, even when
[`client_identity: credential`](/kmip-server/docs/credentials/#client-identity) gives its users
and devices their own managed objects; there are no per-user permissions on
them. A System Object's attributes cannot be edited: obliterate and re-create
it.

## Login and tickets

Login, Logout and Delegated Login follow the 2.x rules in
[Login and tickets](/kmip-server/docs/tickets/), with these 3.0 differences:

- Login needs a user who proves a password in the same request; a 2.x Login
  needs no credentials.
- 3.0 tickets authenticate only 3.0 requests, and 2.x tickets only 2.x
  requests.
- Each use re-checks that the user and the System credential that proved it
  still exist; obliterating either revokes the ticket.
- Usage Limits (Unit Object) are supported, and Login is never processed
  asynchronously (Mandatory is Invalid Field).

## Obliterate

Obliterate removes an object record completely, unlike Destroy, which keeps
metadata; the identifier may then be reused. Later references are Object Not
Found. It needs an explicit policy grant of operation 61, and an
administrator for System Objects. Obliterating a credential stops it
authenticating and revokes tickets it proved; obliterating a user retires its
name permanently.

## Constraints

Set Constraints and Get Constraints restrict the objects an owner may
create. In 3.0 requests each managed-object owner has its own set; KMIP 2.1
requests read and replace one server-wide set, which also applies to 3.0
requests ([server defaults and constraints](/kmip-server/docs/defaults-and-constraints/#constraints)).
The draft defines the Constraint structure (Object Types, Object Groups,
Attributes) but not how the fields combine; this server reads them as
follows:

- A constraint applies to a new object whose type is in Object Types (all
  types if absent) and, if Object Groups is present, that has a matching Group
  Link.
- It is satisfied when every attribute in Attributes matches the new object
  as a Locate filter would.
- It is checked after each 3.0 creating operation (Create, Create Key Pair,
  Register, Re-key, Re-key Key Pair, Derive Key, Certify, Re-certify, the
  Split Key operations, Import). A violation fails the item with Constraint
  Violation and rolls it back.
- A new object must satisfy the owner's set and the server set. 3.0 Get
  Constraints returns the owner's set only; 2.1 Get Constraints returns the
  server set.
- Existing objects, later attribute changes, System Objects and
  Re-Provision are not checked.
- Set Constraints replaces the owner's whole set; an empty structure removes
  it. At most 32 constraints with 32 attributes and 32 groups each.

## Other 3.0 additions

- Group Link: multi-instance, the group need not exist; Locate can filter on
  it.
- Post-quantum keys and Encapsulate/Decapsulate:
  [algorithms](/kmip-server/docs/algorithms/#post-quantum-keys).
- Certificate Request Link on issued certificates.
- Set Defaults (server-wide, as in 2.1:
  [server defaults](/kmip-server/docs/defaults-and-constraints/#set-defaults)) and
  Re-Provision (with `--provisioning-ca`, as in 2.1:
  [Re-Provision](/kmip-server/docs/re-provision/)).

Not implemented: HOTP and server-generated seeds, authentication by
certificate credentials, and Notify and Put for 3.0 endpoints.
