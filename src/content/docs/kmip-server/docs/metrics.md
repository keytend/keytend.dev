Part of [configuration and operations](/kmip-server/docs/#configuration-and-operations).

`GET /metrics` on the health listener (`--health-listen`, default
`0.0.0.0:8080`) returns operator metrics in the Prometheus text exposition
format 0.0.4 (`Content-Type: text/plain; version=0.0.4; charset=utf-8`). The
KMIP listeners (5696 binary TTLV, 5697 HTTPS) never serve it.

## Settings

| Setting (environment) | Values | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--metrics` (`KMIP_METRICS`) | `on`, `off` | `on` | `off`: `/metrics` answers 404 and no object census runs. |
| `--metrics-object-census-interval` (`KMIP_METRICS_OBJECT_CENSUS_INTERVAL`) | `0`, or `10`–`86400` | `300` | Seconds between object censuses; `0` runs none (no `kmip_objects` families). |

`/livez`, `/readyz`, `/connection-metrics` and
`keytend-kmip-server healthcheck` work with either value. Metrics are on by
default because they carry no key material, identifiers or names (below).
Set `off` where even aggregate request volume and failure mix must not be
readable on the health port.

## What is exposed

Label values derived from requests come from fixed tables in the server, so
clients cannot create series: an operation, protocol version or result reason
the tables do not name is counted as `unknown`, and a response item without
an Operation field as `none`. The build and provider labels describe the
executable and OpenSSL ([build and process](#build-and-process)).

### Build and process

| Family | Type | Labels | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `kmip_build_info` | gauge (1) | `version`, `commit`, `binary_sha256`, `openssl`, `fips_mode` | Version, commit, executable digest and linked OpenSSL (below). |
| `kmip_fips_mode` | gauge | | 1 in FIPS mode. |
| `kmip_fips_provider_info` | gauge (1) | `provider`, `name`, `version`, `build_info` | FIPS mode only: the loaded `fips` and `base` providers (below). |
| `kmip_fips_provider_status` | gauge | `provider` | FIPS mode only: provider status read at each scrape: 1 running, 0 error state, -1 not reported. |
| `process_start_time_seconds` | gauge | | Start time. |
| `kmip_uptime_seconds` | gauge | | Uptime. |
| `kmip_ready` | gauge | | 1 when `/readyz` would answer 200 (engine available, live-history check passes). |

`kmip_build_info`'s `commit` is `unknown` in the image build, and
`binary_sha256` (the SHA-256 of the running executable) is `pending` just
after start. `kmip_fips_provider_info` labels the providers as they report
themselves, as `keytend-kmip-server --fips fips-check` prints them.

### Store

| Family | Type | Labels | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `kmip_store_verified_timestamp_seconds` | gauge | | When the audit chain and object state index were verified. This happens at start only; a failure stops the server. |
| `kmip_store_audit_checkpoint_verified` | gauge | | 1 when `--audit-checkpoint` was given and verified at start. |
| `kmip_last_backup_timestamp_seconds` | gauge | | When the last successful `backup` of the database was taken, read at each scrape from `<database>.last-backup`, which `backup` writes when it can write to the database's directory ([backup](/kmip-server/docs/backup-restore/#back-up)). 0 when none is recorded. Alert when it is older than your backup interval. |
| `kmip_store_database_bytes` | gauge | | SQLite page count times page size (main file; the WAL is excluded). |
| `kmip_store_free_bytes` | gauge | | SQLite free-list size times page size. |

### Requests and leases

| Family | Type | Labels | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `kmip_requests_total` | counter | `version`, `encoding` | Request messages answered, by response version and encoding (below). |
| `kmip_requests_unanswered_total` | counter | `encoding` | Request messages the engine could not answer with KMIP (no conforming response fitted, or an internal failure closed the exchange). |
| `kmip_operations_total` | counter | `version`, `encoding`, `operation`, `status`, `reason` | One per response batch item, labelled with KMIP names (below). |
| `kmip_request_duration_seconds` | histogram | `operation` | Engine time per request message, 0.5 ms to 10 s (below). |
| `kmip_request_batch_items` | histogram | | Batch items per answered message (buckets 1 to 128). |
| `kmip_lease_max_seconds` | gauge | | `--max-lease-seconds` (0: no lease limit). |
| `kmip_leases_granted_total` | counter | | Obtain Lease items that succeeded. |
| `kmip_leases_refused_total` | counter | `reason` | Obtain Lease items that failed, by Result Reason. |

- `version` is the response header's protocol version; `encoding` is `ttlv`,
  `json` or `xml`, the HTTPS response encoding (the binary listener is always
  `ttlv`).
- `kmip_operations_total` labels use KMIP names, for example
  `reason="ItemNotFound"` (`none` when absent). An asynchronous submission
  counts once, as `OperationPending`.
- `kmip_request_duration_seconds` times the engine only: a multi-item message
  is one sample with `operation="batch"`, and TLS, framing, the engine lock
  wait and header-credential derivation are excluded.

### Objects (census)

| Family | Type | Labels | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `kmip_objects` | gauge | `type`, `state` | Objects by Object Type and State at the last census. The server's own records (server defaults and constraints, 3.0 owner constraints, Re-Provision fingerprint records) count as `type="unknown"`. |
| `kmip_objects_unreadable` | gauge | | Records the last census could not authenticate (AES-256-GCM tag bound to owner and identifier) or parse. Should be 0; otherwise run `check-store`. |
| `kmip_object_census_timestamp_seconds` | gauge | | When the last census finished. |
| `kmip_object_census_duration_seconds` | gauge | | How long it took. |
| `kmip_object_census_interval_seconds` | gauge | | The census interval setting. |

### Connections and TLS

| Family | Type | Labels | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `kmip_connections_accepted_total` | counter | `listener` (`ttlv`, `https`) | Connections accepted. |
| `kmip_connections_closed_total` | counter | `listener` | Connections closed. |
| `kmip_connections_errored_total` | counter | `listener` | Connections that ended with an error (handshake, refused certificate, framing, timeout, I/O). |
| `kmip_connections_cancelled_total` | counter | `listener` | Connections cancelled before they finished (shutdown drain). |
| `kmip_connections_active` | gauge | `listener` | Open connections. |
| `kmip_connections_idle_closed_total` | counter | `listener` | Closed after `--idle-timeout`. |
| `kmip_connections_refused_unlisted_total` | counter | `listener` | CA-valid certificate without a policy entry, or one a Re-Provision retired: one Permission Denied answer, then closed. |
| `kmip_tls_handshakes_total` | counter | `listener` | Handshakes started. |
| `kmip_tls_handshakes_succeeded_total` | counter | `listener` | Handshakes completed. |
| `kmip_tls_handshake_failures_total` | counter | `listener`, `reason` | Failed handshakes by [reason](#tls-handshake-failure-reasons). |

Admission to `--max-connections`, the same values as
[`/connection-metrics`](#connection-counters), all without labels:

| Family | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `kmip_connections_max` | gauge | The `--max-connections` setting. |
| `kmip_connections_peak_active` | gauge | Most connections open at once since start. |
| `kmip_connections_accept_errors_total` | counter | Failed `accept()` calls on the KMIP listeners. |
| `kmip_connection_admission_waits_total` | counter | Times the accept loop waited for a free connection slot. |
| `kmip_connection_admission_waiting` | gauge | 1 while the accept loop waits for a free slot. |
| `kmip_connection_admission_wait_seconds_total` | counter | Total time the accept loop waited. |

Never exposed: key material, object identifiers, principal or user names,
certificate subjects or fingerprints, Names, attribute values, peer addresses,
request contents and error messages.

### TLS handshake failure reasons

Classified from OpenSSL reason strings; nothing from the peer is copied.

| `reason` | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `no_client_certificate` | The client sent no certificate. |
| `certificate_rejected` | The client chain, CRL or expiry check failed. |
| `peer_alert` | The client aborted, for example because it does not trust the server certificate. |
| `protocol_version` | No common TLS version. |
| `no_shared_parameters` | No common suites, groups or signature algorithms. |
| `not_tls` | Plaintext or HTTP on the TLS port. |
| `timeout` | The 10-second handshake deadline passed. |
| `cancelled` | The server was shutting down. |
| `connection_closed`, `other` | Anything else. |

### Connection counters

`GET /connection-metrics` on the health listener returns the listeners'
connection counters as one JSON object, each a total over both listeners:

```json
{
  "accept_error_total": 0,
  "active": 0,
  "admission_wait_ns_total": 0,
  "admission_wait_total": 0,
  "admission_waiting": 0,
  "cancelled_total": 0,
  "clean_total": 16,
  "closed_total": 16,
  "error_total": 0,
  "https_accepted_total": 12,
  "idle_timeout_total": 0,
  "lifetime_timeout_total": 0,
  "max_connections": 64,
  "peak_active": 1,
  "tcp_accepted_total": 16,
  "tls_cancelled_total": 0,
  "tls_failed_total": 0,
  "tls_started_total": 16,
  "tls_succeeded_total": 16,
  "tls_timeout_total": 0,
  "ttlv_accepted_total": 4,
  "ttlv_responses_total": 14
}
```

The metrics above carry the same counts per listener:

| Field | Metric |
| --- | --- |
| `tcp_accepted_total`, `ttlv_accepted_total`, `https_accepted_total` | `kmip_connections_accepted_total` (all, `listener="ttlv"`, `listener="https"`) |
| `active`, `peak_active`, `max_connections` | `kmip_connections_active`, `kmip_connections_peak_active`, `kmip_connections_max` |
| `closed_total` | `kmip_connections_closed_total` |
| `error_total` | `kmip_connections_errored_total` |
| `idle_timeout_total` | `kmip_connections_idle_closed_total` |
| `cancelled_total` | `kmip_connections_cancelled_total` |
| `clean_total` | connections closed without an error (no metric) |
| `accept_error_total` | `kmip_connections_accept_errors_total` |
| `tls_started_total`, `tls_succeeded_total` | `kmip_tls_handshakes_total`, `kmip_tls_handshakes_succeeded_total` |
| `tls_failed_total`, `tls_timeout_total`, `tls_cancelled_total` | `kmip_tls_handshake_failures_total`: every `reason` except `timeout` and `cancelled`; `reason="timeout"`; `reason="cancelled"` |
| `ttlv_responses_total` | binary KMIP responses written (no metric) |
| `admission_wait_total` | `kmip_connection_admission_waits_total` |
| `admission_waiting` | `kmip_connection_admission_waiting` |
| `admission_wait_ns_total` | `kmip_connection_admission_wait_seconds_total` (in seconds) |
| `lifetime_timeout_total` | reserved, always 0: there is no overall connection lifetime |

The server also logs the object as `Connection lifecycle counters` every 30
seconds (`"phase":"periodic"`, the first right after `KMIP listener ready`)
and at shutdown (`"phase":"shutdown"`). In the log line the whole object is
one JSON string in `fields.counters`: parse that string to read a counter.

## Scraping

### Network exposure

The health listener is plain, unauthenticated HTTP on
`--health-listen` (default `0.0.0.0:8080`), the same listener as `/livez`,
`/readyz` and `/connection-metrics`; KMIP ports never serve metrics. Keep it on
a management network: the [container example](/kmip-server/docs/quick-start/#run-the-container) publishes it on
`127.0.0.1:8080` only. Metrics carry no secrets, but they reveal request
volume, the version and operation mix, failure reasons and object counts per
type.

### Kubernetes

The [chart](/kmip-server/docs/kubernetes/#monitoring) annotates the pod with
`prometheus.io/scrape: "true"`, `prometheus.io/port: "8080"` and
`prometheus.io/path: /metrics`, names its port 8080 `health` (the Services
publish the KMIP ports only), and with `metrics.podMonitor.enabled` creates a
Prometheus Operator PodMonitor whose `job` label is `keytend-kmip-server`, as
the alert rules below expect. Your Prometheus resource must select it (its
`podMonitorSelector` and `podMonitorNamespaceSelector`; set
`metrics.podMonitor.labels`). Without the operator, a scrape job:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: keytend-kmip-server
    kubernetes_sd_configs:
      - role: pod
        namespaces:
          names: [keytend-kmip-server]
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_label_app_kubernetes_io_component, __meta_kubernetes_pod_container_port_name]
        regex: server;health
        action: keep
      - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_namespace]
        target_label: namespace
```

Either way, the chart's NetworkPolicy admits port 8080 only from
`networkPolicy.metrics`: by default pods labelled
`access: keytend-kmip-server-metrics` in namespaces labelled
`kmip-metrics: "true"`. Label the Prometheus namespace and pods, or change
the selectors. Kubelet probes reach `/readyz` and `/livez` from the node;
whether the NetworkPolicy applies to node-originated traffic depends on the
CNI, so test both the probes and the scrape after applying the policy.

## Alerts

[`deploy/prometheus/keytend-kmip-server-rules.yaml`](https://github.com/keytend/keytend-kmip-server/blob/770ad850a3498544ef7a2259cece1a220e3d4520/deploy/prometheus/keytend-kmip-server-rules.yaml)
holds suggested alert rules, ready for a Prometheus `rule_files` entry or a
PrometheusRule resource; the chart's `metrics.prometheusRule.enabled` creates
that resource for the release's namespace and volume, with `KmipBackupStale`
added for its [backups](/kmip-server/docs/backup-restore/#scheduled-backups-on-kubernetes). Adjust `job` to your scrape configuration and the
thresholds to your traffic. For example, the first rule:

```yaml
      - alert: KmipServerDown
        expr: up{job="keytend-kmip-server"} == 0 or kmip_ready == 0 or absent(up{job="keytend-kmip-server"})
        for: 2m
```

`absent()` covers a target that disappears: when Kubernetes discovery drops
the only pod, `up` and `kmip_ready` have no series at all, and the first two
conditions match nothing.

| Rule | Fires when | Tune |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `KmipServerDown`, `KmipLeaseOutageBudget` | Down, not ready or not scraped for 2 or 15 minutes | The second's `for` from the Lease Time ([below](#lease-outage-alerts)) |
| `KmipLeaseTimeChanged` | `--max-lease-seconds` changed | Then update `KmipLeaseOutageBudget` |
| `KmipFipsProviderError` | The FIPS provider is in its error state | |
| `KmipUnansweredRequests`, `KmipServerSideFailures` | Internal failures, in 10 minutes | |
| `KmipLeaseRefusals` | A client renews a lease on an object it can no longer use | |
| `KmipCertificateTrouble` | Rejected, missing or unlisted client certificates, in 15 minutes | |
| `KmipConnectionCapacity`, `KmipConnectionAdmissionWaiting` | Over 80% of `--max-connections` for 10 minutes; connections waiting for 5 | The 0.8 ratio |
| `KmipStoreIntegrity`, `KmipCensusStalled` | A record does not authenticate; the census is stuck | |
| `KmipDiskGrowth` | The database will pass 80% of 10 Gi within 7 days | Your volume size |
| `KmipVolumeFreeSpace` | Under 20% free on the PVC (kubelet metrics) | Only where Prometheus scrapes the kubelet |
| `KmipBackupStale` (chart only) | No successful backup for 26 hours, or none since a start 26 hours ago | `metrics.prometheusRule.backupMaxAgeSeconds` |

`kmip_store_database_bytes` counts the main database file only, not its WAL
or backups written into the volume, so keep the volume free-space rule (or
your platform's equivalent) as well.

### Lease-outage alerts

From [Lease Time and KMS outages](/kmip-server/docs/operations/#lease-time-and-kms-outages): a
lease-honouring client stops using an object when its lease ends, counted
from its last successful renewal. With Lease Time `L`
(`kmip_lease_max_seconds`) and clients that renew at fraction `r` of the lease
(commonly `r = 0.5`), a client has at least `(1 - r) * L` left when an outage
begins. Page early enough to restore within that budget, including a restore
from backup:

- Page when the server has been unavailable for half the guaranteed
  remainder: `for: (1 - r) * L / 2` on the down condition
  (`KmipLeaseOutageBudget`). For the default `L = 3600` s and `r = 0.5`, that
  is `for: 15m`, leaving 15 minutes before the first clients stop. The `for`
  duration is static: update the rule when `--max-lease-seconds` changes
  (`KmipLeaseTimeChanged` reminds you).
- Alert on missing renewals while the server is up:
  `sum(increase(kmip_leases_granted_total[<renewal interval> * 2])) == 0` where
  clients are known to renew, since a network or policy change can stop them
  reaching the server without the server going down.
- `kmip_lease_max_seconds == 0` means no lease limit: outages do not stop
  clients, and no lease alert is needed, but use after Destroy is unbounded.

Objects created before a `--max-lease-seconds` change keep their stored Lease
Time, and a Deactivation Date or Protect Stop Date can end an Active lease
sooner. Size the `for` duration for the shortest effective lease still in use,
so the alert fires before the first clients stop.

## Cost

Counters cost one small lock per message. The object census decrypts every
object record each interval, 256 per engine lock, so requests interleave with
it; watch `kmip_object_census_duration_seconds` and raise the interval (or set
`0`) for very large stores.

## Known limits

- The alert rules have not been run against a live Prometheus scrape of a
  deployment.
- The store's audit chain and object index are verified in full at start
  only, so `kmip_store_verified_timestamp_seconds` is the start time. The
  [live history check](/kmip-server/docs/store-integrity/#live-history-check) runs on every
  request but does not rescan older history; `check-store` remains the full
  check.
- Latency is per message, not per batch item, and excludes lock wait.
- Deferred asynchronous runs and server-to-client deliveries are not counted.
- `commit` is `unknown` unless the build sets `KEYTEND_KMIP_SERVER_COMMIT`; use
  `binary_sha256` to match a running server to a build or to test evidence.
