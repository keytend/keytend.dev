Part of [configuration and operations](/kmip-server/docs/#configuration-and-operations).

Mutual TLS always selects the client's principal. A request may also carry
an Authentication structure in its header; the server then checks every
credential in it against users and devices provisioned for that principal in
the users file (`serve --users`, `KMIP_USERS`), in every protocol version.

:::note[Requests without credentials are still served]
`--users` does not make credentials mandatory. A request without an
Authentication structure is still served on its certificate alone, as the
principal. Credentials add a check and can narrow the identity; they never
replace the certificate policy.
:::

- All credentials must verify. A wrong, unknown or unverifiable credential
  fails the whole message with Authentication Not Successful (Result Reason
  3), the same answer for every cause. A credential is never ignored.
- A principal without provisioned users or devices cannot present
  credentials.
- Users and devices of one principal are invisible to every other principal.
- A verified credential narrows the identity to that user or device: the
  audit chain records `principal/user` or `principal/device`. Objects still
  belong to the principal unless the policy sets
  [`client_identity`](#client-identity) to `credential`.
- 1.0 and 1.1 accept one credential, later editions up to four. Several
  credentials may prove the same user (a password and a One Time Password,
  for example), but together they may name at most one user and one device,
  and hold at most one ticket.

## Credential types

| Type | Editions | Checked against |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Username and Password | all | the user's salted password verifier |
| Device | 1.1+ | a provisioned device: every identifier presented must equal its value, and its password must verify |
| Hashed Password | 2.0+ | the user's `hashed_password` entry ([below](#hashed-password)) |
| One Time Password | 2.0+ | the user's TOTP seed and password ([below](#one-time-password)) |
| Ticket | 2.0+ | a live Login or Delegated Login ticket ([below](#tickets)) |
| Attestation | 1.2+ | not supported (Feature Not Supported): KMIP defines no verification procedure |

A credential type the edition does not define is Invalid Field.

## Tickets

A Ticket credential presents a ticket from
[Login or Delegated Login](/kmip-server/docs/tickets/) (2.0 and later):

- A Login ticket authenticates only for the principal that obtained it, in
  requests of the same major edition (2.0/2.1, or 3.0), and stands for the
  user or device that Login proved, or for the principal alone (a 2.x Login
  needs no credentials). It may be combined with a password or device
  credential: of that same user or device when the ticket stands for one,
  otherwise any that verifies.
- A delegated ticket is a bearer ticket: any listed certificate may present
  it, alone, and acts as the delegator within the ticket's Rights.
- An unknown, expired, logged-out or exhausted ticket, a foreign Login
  ticket or a second ticket is Authentication Not Successful.
- A request authenticated by a ticket cannot obtain another one.

## Users file

```json
{
  "users": {
    "<certificate fingerprint from the policy>": [
      {"username": "app", "administrator": false,
       "password_verifier": {"algorithm": "PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-256", "iterations": 600000,
                             "salt": "<hex>", "hash": "<hex>"}}
    ]
  },
  "devices": {
    "<certificate fingerprint from the policy>": [
      {"name": "meter-1", "device_serial_number": "serNum123456",
       "device_identifier": "devID2233",
       "password_verifier": {"algorithm": "PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-256", "iterations": 600000,
                             "salt": "<hex>", "hash": "<hex>"}}
    ]
  }
}
```

Print a verifier with the server (the password is read from standard input):

```sh title="Users file"
printf '%s\n' 'a long random password' | keytend-kmip-server password-verifier
```

Startup refuses the file unless:

- every verifier is PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-256 with 600,000 iterations, a 16–64 byte
  salt and a 32-byte hash, or the legacy scrypt form (N=2^15, r=8, p=1), which
  never authenticates in [FIPS mode](/kmip-server/docs/fips/);
- each device has a unique name, a password verifier and at least one of
  Device Serial Number, Network, Machine or Media Identifier, unique per
  principal;
- certificates mapped to one principal agree on its users and devices;
- every fingerprint is in the [policy](/kmip-server/docs/configuration/#policy-file), and no
  field is unknown.

`administrator: true` marks a user who may create and obliterate System
Objects in the 3.0 draft. Each verification costs one PBKDF2 evaluation; at
most four run at a time. An unknown username also costs one PBKDF2
evaluation, so response time does not separate unknown users from users with
PBKDF2 verifiers. A legacy scrypt verifier costs one scrypt evaluation
instead, which takes measurably different time: convert scrypt verifiers with
`password-verifier`. There is no per-client rate limit.

## Hashed Password

KMIP 2.0 and later. The client sends Username, a Date Time Extended
Timestamp, an optional Hashing Algorithm (default SHA-256) and
Hashed Password = Hash(S1 ‖ Timestamp) ‖ S2, where S1 = Hash(Username ‖
Password) and S2 = Hash(Password ‖ Username), all over UTF-8 bytes. The server
answers with Server Hashed Password = Hash(Timestamp ‖ S1 ‖ Hash(S2)) in the
response header, so the client can check the server too.

The user needs a `hashed_password` entry. S1 is stored as is (the server
needs it to recompute the proof); S2 is kept only as a salted verifier:

```python
import hashlib, os
u, p = b"app", b"<long random password>"
s1 = hashlib.sha256(u + p).digest()
s2 = hashlib.sha256(p + u).digest()
salt = os.urandom(16)
entry = {"hashing_algorithm": "SHA-256", "s1": s1.hex(),
         "s2_verifier": {"algorithm": "PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-256", "iterations": 600000,
                         "salt": salt.hex(),
                         "hash": hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac("sha256", s2, salt, 600000).hex()}}
```

- The Timestamp must increase for every accepted request of the user and be
  within 300 s of the server clock. The last accepted value is stored in the
  database and survives restarts.
- `hashing_algorithm` may be SHA-256, SHA-384 or SHA-512.

## One Time Password

KMIP 2.0 and later, TOTP (RFC 6238) only:
`"one_time_password": {"seed": "<hex>", "digest": "SHA-1", "digits": 6, "interval": 30}`
(seed at least 128 bits; digest SHA-1, SHA-256 or SHA-512; 6–8 digits;
interval 15–300 s).

- The Password field is required and must verify: a code alone is not
  accepted.
- A code is accepted for the current time step or one step either side, and
  each step only once; the counter is stored in the database.

## Stored secrets

Neither a `hashed_password` nor a `one_time_password` entry alone lets a
reader of the users file authenticate: a Hashed Password proof also needs S2,
and a One Time Password also needs the password. But S1 lets that reader
guess the password at hash speed, not PBKDF2 speed, and a copied TOTP seed
removes the second factor, leaving only the password. `serve` therefore
refuses a users file with `hashed_password` or `one_time_password` entries
unless `--allow-stored-credential-secrets`
(`KMIP_ALLOW_STORED_CREDENTIAL_SECRETS`) is set. Use long random passwords for
these users. Restoring an older backup rewinds the replay counters.

## Client identity

By default every verified user and device of a principal shares the
principal's objects. With `"client_identity": "credential"` in the policy
entry, a request whose credentials verify acts as that user (or the device,
when no user credential is present):

- that identity owns the objects it creates and sees only its own; other users,
  devices and the bare certificate get the
  [unknown-identifier](/kmip-server/docs/messages/#unknown-identifiers) answer, as for another
  principal (Item Not Found in 1.x, mostly Object Not Found in 2.x). Requests
  without Authentication keep the principal's identity;
- the certificate's operation list still limits every identity;
- an `object_grants` entry can grant a user's or device's object with
  `"user": "app"` or `"device": "meter-1"` next to `owner`;
- objects created before the option was turned on stay with the principal.

Every certificate mapped to one principal must agree on `client_identity`.
