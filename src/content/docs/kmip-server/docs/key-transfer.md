Part of the [feature reference](/kmip-server/docs/#feature-reference).

How Get, wrapped Get and Register, Import and Export return or accept key
material, and the protection storage the server reports.

## Get

- Get returns the object in its stored format unless the request names
  another Key Format Type; supported conversions are listed per key type in
  [algorithms](/kmip-server/docs/algorithms/). An unsupported format is Key Format Type Not
  Supported.
- Sensitive objects are never returned in plaintext, but can be returned
  wrapped. Non-extractable objects are never returned. Both default to
  allowing retrieval.
- The first Get that returns material sets Fresh to False.
- Get of a destroyed object fails (Illegal Operation in 1.x, Object Destroyed
  from 2.0); see [lifecycle](/kmip-server/docs/lifecycle/#destroy).
- An archived object must be recovered first.

## Wrapped Get and Register

A Key Wrapping Specification on Get returns the key encrypted under another
key the caller owns; a wrapped Key Block on Register is unwrapped and stored.

| Item | Support |
| --- | --- |
| Mechanisms | AES Key Wrap (RFC 3394, block cipher mode 13) and with Padding (RFC 5649, mode 12) under 128-, 192- or 256-bit keys; RSA OAEP with independent message and MGF1 hashes and an optional label |
| Wrapping key | Owned by the caller, with the Wrap Key usage bit for Get and Unwrap Key for Register. An RSA public key wraps; its linked (or an explicitly named) private key unwraps. State and dates apply. |
| Encoding | TTLV-encoded Key Value by default. From 1.1, No Encoding for byte-string key material without attributes. Key Wrapping Data echoes Encoding Option only when the request gave one. |
| Parameters | Explicit wrapping parameters must equal one of the wrapping key's stored Cryptographic Parameters; omitted, the first stored instance is used. A mismatch is Item Not Found in 1.x. |
| Attributes | Selected attributes are wrapped with the key and restored by Register, merged with the request's own attributes. |
| Usage limits | A wrapped Get charges the wrapping key once, or by the plaintext length. Unwrapping is not charged. |

Register checks integrity, unwraps, validates the material as for a plaintext
Register and stores it encrypted at rest. From 1.4 it also keeps the original
envelope, which Get returns with Key Wrap Type As Registered.

Not supported: MAC/sign or combined encrypt-and-MAC wrapping, TR-31,
certificate-based or opaque wrapping keys, ML-KEM wrapping keys, and wrapping
keys that are themselves stored wrapped.

### Example: fetch a Sensitive key wrapped

With the [quick-start server](/kmip-server/docs/quick-start/) and the
[HTTPS shell functions](/kmip-server/docs/clients/https/) loaded:
[`create-kek.json`](https://github.com/keytend/keytend-kmip-server/blob/802895e20231a5c04fc97b7a6b29f59232f280a6/examples/https/create-kek.json) creates and activates
an AES-256 wrapping key with the Wrap Key and Unwrap Key bits and a stored
AES Key Wrap parameter;
[`create-sensitive.json`](https://github.com/keytend/keytend-kmip-server/blob/802895e20231a5c04fc97b7a6b29f59232f280a6/examples/https/create-sensitive.json) creates a
Sensitive data key; [`get-wrapped.json`](https://github.com/keytend/keytend-kmip-server/blob/802895e20231a5c04fc97b7a6b29f59232f280a6/examples/https/get-wrapped.json)
fetches it wrapped under the first key, without encoding (`NoEncoding`).

```sh title="Example: fetch a Sensitive key wrapped"
KEK=$(kmip create-kek.json | field UniqueIdentifier)
ID=$(kmip create-sensitive.json | field UniqueIdentifier)
kmip get.json ID="$ID" | field ResultReason
kmip get-wrapped.json ID="$ID" KEK="$KEK" | field KeyValue
```

<div class="kt-output">

```text title="Output" wrap hangingIndent=2
Sensitive
d551f9bee8591e277667f3b43af9390f2c5f477fa67f4e08cce9ee2a3f1c358509ba8775d1e68105
```

</div>

The plain Get is refused; the wrapped one returns the 32-byte key as 40 bytes
of RFC 3394 output, which any AES Key Wrap implementation unwraps with the
wrapping key (for example `aes_key_unwrap` in Python's `cryptography`).

## Import and Export

KMIP 1.4 and later. Export returns the object, its identifier and all its
attributes; Import restores such a record as it was, including state, dates,
usage counters and server-maintained attributes.

- **Use Import as restore authority only.** An authorized Import can replace
  an object's state, material and remaining budget. Import writes objects as
  the calling principal and never replaces another principal's object, so give
  operation 42 to a separate administrative certificate mapped to the owner's
  principal ([role templates](/kmip-server/docs/configuration/#role-templates)), not to
  database clients.
- Import requires an explicit identifier (at most 1,024 bytes).
  An existing identifier fails with Object Already Exists unless Replace
  Existing is True; another owner's object is never replaced. Name and Short
  Unique Identifier uniqueness apply.
- Mandatory restore attributes include State, Initial Date and Last Change
  Date; from 1.4 the extraction flags and histories, from 2.0 Fresh, Key
  Format Type and the Short Unique Identifier, and in the 3.0 draft Object
  Class. Plaintext material needs a matching SHA-256 Digest.
- For wrapped input, Key Wrap Type Not Wrapped unwraps and validates before
  storing. As Registered stores the ciphertext as it is, without needing the
  wrapping key yet; the key is unwrapped only when it is used, with a wrapping
  key the caller owns, and plaintext is never written to storage. In 2.x and
  3.0 the Key Wrap Type is required exactly when the input is wrapped; in 1.4
  an omitted type keeps the envelope.
- Export follows Get's format, wrapping and extraction rules. A destroyed
  object exports its metadata without material, which Import restores as a
  destroyed record.
- TTLV-encoded envelopes cannot move As Registered between major versions
  (1.x and 2.x); No Encoding envelopes can.

The server cannot enforce usage limits on exported key material.

### Example: export a key and import it again

With the [quick-start server](/kmip-server/docs/quick-start/) and the
[HTTPS shell functions](/kmip-server/docs/clients/https/) loaded:
[`export.json`](https://github.com/keytend/keytend-kmip-server/blob/802895e20231a5c04fc97b7a6b29f59232f280a6/examples/https/export.json) exports a key's record, and
[`import.json`](https://github.com/keytend/keytend-kmip-server/blob/802895e20231a5c04fc97b7a6b29f59232f280a6/examples/https/import.json) imports a symmetric key's
`Attributes` and `SymmetricKey` structures under its identifier, with Replace
Existing True. `field` prints a structure as the JSON list that `import.json`
takes. This exports a new key, retires it with
[`retire.json`](https://github.com/keytend/keytend-kmip-server/blob/802895e20231a5c04fc97b7a6b29f59232f280a6/examples/https/retire.json) (Activate, Revoke, Destroy),
then restores it:

```bash title="Example: export a key and import it again"
ID=$(kmip create.json | field UniqueIdentifier)
R=$(kmip export.json ID="$ID")   # the record, key material included: protect it
kmip retire.json ID="$ID" >/dev/null
kmip get.json ID="$ID" | field ResultReason
kmip import.json ID="$ID" ATTRIBUTES="$(field Attributes <<<"$R")" \
  KEY="$(field SymmetricKey <<<"$R")" | field ResultStatus
K=$(field KeyMaterial <<<"$R")
[ -n "$K" ] && [ "$(kmip get.json ID="$ID" | field KeyMaterial)" = "$K" ] && echo restored
```

<div class="kt-output">

```text title="Output" wrap hangingIndent=2
ObjectDestroyed
Success
restored
```

</div>

The restored key is Pre-Active again, as it was when exported. The same
`import.json` can carry the record to another server, under the same
principal name.

## Protection storage

From 2.0, the only storage the server offers is Software (Protection Storage
Mask 1); Query Storage Protection Masks reports that. A request whose
acceptable masks need Hardware or another property fails (Protection Storage
Unavailable, or Private/Public Protection Storage Unavailable for key pairs;
Feature Not Supported for Derive Key) rather than downgrading. Each object
records its own selection, which is read-only.
