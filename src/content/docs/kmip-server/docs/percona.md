Part of [integrations](/kmip-server/docs/#integrations).

Configuration for using keytend-kmip-server as the key manager of Percona
Server for MongoDB 8.0 (tested with 8.0.34-15) and Percona Server for MySQL
8.4 (tested with 8.4.11-11). Give each database its own client certificate and
principal with its [role](/kmip-server/docs/configuration/#role-templates): operations
`[1, 3, 8, 10, 11, 12, 18, 24, 30]` for MongoDB, and the same plus Revoke (19)
and Destroy (20) for MySQL, whose component removes keys.

## Percona Server for MongoDB

```yaml
security:
  enableEncryption: true
  kmip:
    serverName: keytend-kmip-server.keytend-kmip-server.svc.cluster.local
    port: 5696
    serverCAFile: /etc/kmip/server-ca.pem
    clientCertificateFile: /etc/kmip/client-chain-and-key.pem
    activateKeys: true
    keyStatePollingSeconds: 30
```

- `clientCertificateFile` holds the client certificate chain followed by its
  private key, in one PEM file. With the names of
  [issuing certificates](/kmip-server/docs/tls-setup/#issuing-them-with-openssl), and
  `ca.pem` as `serverCAFile`:

  ```sh title="Percona Server for MongoDB"
  (umask 077; cat orders-db.pem orders-db.key > client-chain-and-key.pem)   # intermediates go after orders-db.pem
  ```

- The server certificate needs a subject alternative name for `serverName`.
- Without `keyIdentifier`, the database registers a new master key on first
  start and remembers its identifier. `db.serverStatus().encryptionAtRest`
  shows it.
- To rotate the database master key, use Percona's offline procedure: stop
  `mongod`, run it once with `--kmipRotateMasterKey` and the same data
  directory and KMIP settings, let it exit, and start it normally. The old key
  stays on the server; keep it for as long as backups need it.
- With `keyStatePollingSeconds`, `mongod` polls the key state and shuts down
  when its master key is no longer Active (revoked or compromised), so
  revoking the key takes that database offline.
- During a KMIP outage a running `mongod` keeps its cached key, so a
  revocation takes effect only when it can poll again.

## Percona Server for MySQL

Load `component_keyring_kmip` with a global manifest `mysqld.my` next to the
`mysqld` binary:

```json
{"components": "file://component_keyring_kmip"}
```

and configure it in `component_keyring_kmip.cnf` in the plugin directory:

```json
{
  "server_addr": "keytend-kmip-server.keytend-kmip-server.svc.cluster.local",
  "server_port": "5696",
  "client_ca": "/etc/kmip/client.pem",
  "client_key": "/etc/kmip/client.key",
  "server_ca": "/etc/kmip/server-ca.pem",
  "object_group": "mysql-primary",
  "tls_peer_verification": true,
  "tls_hostname_verification": true
}
```

- `client_ca` is the client **certificate** (the component's name for it).
- Set both verification options to `true`: in 8.4.11 they default to `false`,
  and the component then accepts any server.
- The component keeps one connection open and does not reconnect after the
  server closes it for idleness: the next keyring write fails. Set the
  server's `--idle-timeout` above the database's longest quiet period, or to
  `0` ([settings](/kmip-server/docs/configuration/#listeners-tls-and-identity)).
- `keyring_key_remove` revokes and destroys the key, and
  `ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE BINLOG MASTER KEY` destroys and re-registers fixed
  scratch key names: grant Revoke and Destroy, and keep the server's default
  `--destroyed-name-reuse allow`.
- After a restart the component still uses a master key the server reports as
  Compromised; enforce compromise by rotating
  (`ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE INNODB MASTER KEY`) and re-encrypting.

### Check the keyring

In `mysql`, after the first start:

```sql
SELECT STATUS_KEY, STATUS_VALUE FROM performance_schema.keyring_component_status
  WHERE STATUS_KEY IN ('Component_status', 'Tls_peer_verification', 'Tls_hostname_verification');
CREATE DATABASE kmip_check;
CREATE TABLE kmip_check.t (id INT PRIMARY KEY) ENCRYPTION='Y';
SELECT NAME, ENCRYPTION FROM information_schema.INNODB_TABLESPACES WHERE NAME = 'kmip_check/t';
ALTER INSTANCE ROTATE INNODB MASTER KEY;
```

- `Component_status` is `Active`, and both verification values are `true`.
- The first encrypted table makes InnoDB register its master key on the
  server, an Active AES-256 key in the configured `object_group`, and the
  tablespace shows `ENCRYPTION` `Y`.
- The rotation registers the next master key; the previous one stays Active.
- The keys are named `INNODBKey-<server_uuid>-<n>` (`SELECT @@server_uuid`),
  so a Locate by that Name with the database's certificate finds each one.

## What was tested

- MongoDB: encrypted writes; restarts of the KMIP server and the database;
  backup and restore of the KMIP store; database and storage master-key
  rotation; refusal of untrusted, unlisted and unauthorized certificates;
  shutdown after key compromise; three-member replica sets; and Percona Backup
  for MongoDB 2.17.0 physical and point-in-time restores, including a damaged
  oplog chain and an interrupted restore.
- MySQL: encrypted tables, undo, redo and binary logs; restarts; InnoDB
  master-key rotation; refusal of a wrong CA, wrong hostname and unlisted or
  unauthorized certificates.
