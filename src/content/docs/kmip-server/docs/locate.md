Part of the [feature reference](/kmip-server/docs/#feature-reference).

Locate returns the identifiers of the caller's objects, and of objects
granted to it ([authorization](/kmip-server/docs/authorization/)), that match every filter in
the request.

## Results

- Newest object first (descending creation time).
- Maximum Items and Offset Items page through the results. Offset Items above
  100,000 is refused; a response holds at most 1,000 identifiers.
- A single result sets the ID Placeholder for the next batch item; several
  results clear it.

## Filters

| Filter | Editions | Match |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Object Type, State, Cryptographic Algorithm, Cryptographic Length, Unique Identifier, Short Unique Identifier, Fresh, Sensitive, Extractable and their histories | where defined | equal |
| Cryptographic Usage Mask | all | every bit given must be set |
| Name, Object Group, Application Specific Information, Alternative Name | where defined | any instance equal; an Alternative Name filter may give only the value, only the type, or neither (presence) |
| Cryptographic Parameters, Cryptographic Domain Parameters, Digest, Revocation Reason, Key Value Location, Random Number Generator | where defined | the fields given must match within one instance |
| Contact Information | all | equal text |
| Description, Comment | 1.4+ | equal text |
| Key Format Type | 2.0+ | equal |
| Usage Limits | all | Total and Count are lower bounds; Unit is equal |
| Lease Time | all | interval |
| Dates (Initial, Activation, Deactivation, Process Start, Protect Stop, Compromise, Compromise Occurrence, Destroy, Archive, Last Change, Original Creation) | where defined | see [dates](#date-filters) |
| Link (1.x–2.x), typed links and Group Link (3.0 draft) | where defined | whole structure: link type and target |
| Certificate type, length, identifier, subject and issuer attributes; Digital Signature Algorithm | where defined | equal |
| Opaque Data Type, Protection Storage Mask, Split Key fields, Protection Level, Protection Period, Quantum Safe | where defined | equal |
| Key Value Present | 1.2+ | equal (only objects registered without material carry it) |
| Operation Policy Name | 1.x | `default` matches every object; any other name matches nothing |
| Custom (`x-`) and vendor attributes | all | equal value and type; Attribute Index is ignored |

- A filter on an attribute the edition does not define is Invalid Field. A
  field of the wrong type is Invalid Field. Any attribute not listed here is
  refused with Feature Not Supported.
- There are no wildcards or regular expressions.
- A `y-` filter is valid and matches nothing: the server sets no such
  attribute.

### Date filters

- One value matches exactly. Two values of the same date attribute form an
  inclusive range, in either order.
- A missing date compares as the largest possible date, so a range ending at
  that maximum includes objects without the date. For example, "active at
  time T" is Activation Date ≤ T and Deactivation Date ≥ T, with the upper
  bound of the second range at the maximum.
- More than two values of one date attribute, or a value that is not a
  Date-Time, is Invalid Field.
- Vendor date attributes keep their type: a Date-Time filter does not match a
  Date-Time Extended value.

### Storage status

The Storage Status Mask selects on-line (the default), archived and, from
2.0, destroyed objects; zero selects none. In 1.x, which has no destroyed bit,
an on-line Locate skips destroyed objects unless the filters select the
Destroyed or Destroyed Compromised state or a Destroy Date. An object that is
both archived and destroyed needs both bits.

### Object Group Member (1.1+)

With an Object Group filter:

- Group Member Fresh returns only fresh members (never served by Get),
  oldest first in 1.x so a prepared pool is handed out in creation order,
  newest first from 2.0. No object is generated on demand.
- Group Member Default returns one member, rotating through the group in
  creation order. The position is kept in memory per principal and group, so
  a restart begins again with the oldest member. Offset Items is refused.

Without an Object Group filter the field is Invalid Field.
