## Supported versions

keytend-kmip is experimental and not for production use, in every release. Security fixes are
best effort.

| Version | Security fixes |
|---|---|
| The latest release | yes |
| Any other release or pre-release | no: upgrade to the latest release |

A fix ships as a new release. Upgrading keeps the API and stored data compatible, as
[Compatibility and support](/kmip-java/docs/compatibility/) promises. Upgrade notes are in the
[release notes](/kmip-java/docs/release-notes/), and releases are on the
[releases page](https://github.com/keytend/keytend-kmip-java/releases).

## Reporting a vulnerability

Email the report to <security@keytend.dev>.

Do not open a public issue, pull request or discussion for a suspected
vulnerability.

Please include:

- the keytend-kmip version (or commit) and the JDK version;
- the KMIP version negotiated and, if a real server is involved, which server;
- what an attacker controls (the network, the server's replies, the
  application's input) and what they gain;
- a reproduction, ideally a test against `InMemoryKmipServer` or a TTLV
  transcript. Remove real keys, passwords and certificates from it first.

## What to expect

keytend-kmip is maintained by one person. These are goals, not a service level
agreement:

- acknowledgment within 7 days;
- an initial assessment (in scope or not, and how severe) within 14 days;
- for a confirmed vulnerability, a fixed release within 90 days of the report,
  sooner for a severe one.

A fix is published as a new release with a GitHub security advisory. The
advisory credits the reporter, unless they prefer otherwise. Please keep the
report private until the advisory is published. If we have not agreed on a
date, keep it private for 90 days.

## Scope

In scope are the SDK (`keytend-kmip`), the metrics modules
(`keytend-kmip-micrometer`, `keytend-kmip-opentelemetry`) and the command-line
tool (`keytend-kmip-cli`). For the SDK that covers the protocol layer (TTLV, XML
and JSON codecs, transports, authentication) and the `kms` application API.
The release artifacts and the build that produces them are in scope too.
Examples:

- key material or credentials leaking into strings, exceptions, events, logs,
  metrics or spans;
- a secret the CLI writes to a file that other users can read;
- TLS certificate or hostname validation that can be bypassed;
- a reply from a malicious server that makes the client crash, hang, exhaust
  memory or use the wrong key;
- a call that reports success for something the server did not do.

Out of scope:

- `InMemoryKmipServer` and the other test fixtures. The in-memory server is
  the separate test artifact `keytend-kmip-testing`, not part of the SDK JAR
  or the release's `lib/`. It does not protect what it stores and must not
  hold real keys. A defect in it is an ordinary bug, unless it hides an SDK
  vulnerability.
- The integration application (`keytend-kmip-integration`), the lab servers,
  certificates and Compose files under `integration/`, and the tools under
  `tools/`. They are test and research code.
- Vulnerabilities in KMIP servers. Report those to the server's maintainers.
- Weaknesses of the KMIP protocol itself, or of the 3.0 draft, that the SDK
  implements as specified.
- Attacks that need control of the JVM, its class path or the application's
  configuration.

## Handling secrets

The SDK handles key material and credentials. Java cannot guarantee that memory
is erased. Follow these rules:

- Destroy keys and secrets promptly. Call `DestroyableSecretKey.destroy()`,
  `DataKey.close()` or `SecretData.close()` when you are done, and keep
  references short-lived.
- Expect copies the SDK cannot wipe. The SDK wipes the buffers it owns. It
  cannot wipe `Ttlv` trees, arrays you pass in or receive, JCA objects, the
  KMIP password `String`, or copies made by the TLS stack or the garbage
  collector.
- Do not log values. `toString()` of SDK types is redacted, and so are the
  protocol objects in exceptions. `KmsListener` events carry identifiers and
  outcomes only. A `Ttlv`'s values, its XML or JSON encoding, or a payload you
  retrieved are not redacted, so logging them logs secrets.
- Keep TLS verification on. The SDK verifies the server's certificate chain
  and hostname, over TLS 1.2 or 1.3. Never supply an `SSLContext` or trust
  manager that trusts every certificate, except against a local test server.
- Protect credentials at rest. The SDK reads client private keys, PKCS#12
  files and passwords from where you put them. Protect those files and the
  process environment. Prefer client certificates to passwords where the
  server allows it.
- Keep test fixtures out of production. `InMemoryKmipServer` and the
  certificates under `integration/certs` are for tests only.

The full lists are in [Design notes: Secrets](/kmip-java/docs/kms-design/#secrets)
and [Protocol layer: Secret lifetime](/kmip-java/docs/protocol-layer/#secret-lifetime).

## Verifying release artifacts

Every release is signed, and so is every pre-release (a version such as
`0.10.0-rc.1`). Nothing is published unsigned.

A GitHub release holds these assets, where `X.Y.Z` is the release's version,
such as `0.10.0`, or a pre-release's, such as `0.10.0-rc.1`:

- `keytend-kmip-X.Y.Z.zip`, the binary distribution. It holds no source tree.
  Its `lib/` holds each module's JARs and a CycloneDX SBOM of each module.
  The SDK's (`lib/keytend-kmip-X.Y.Z-cyclonedx.json`) lists slf4j-api, its
  one runtime dependency, and the bundled Caffeine. Its `keytend:shaded` property names Caffeine's relocated package, so a Caffeine
  advisory needs an SDK release. The metrics modules' SBOMs list Micrometer and
  the OpenTelemetry API. The CLI's and the integration application's list the
  libraries `lib/` holds for them. Its `validation/` holds the release's test
  reports ([Where the results are](/kmip-java/docs/validation/#where-the-results-are)).
- `keytend-kmip-X.Y.Z-src.zip`, the source tree that builds the release.
- `keytend-kmip-testing-X.Y.Z.jar`, the in-memory KMIP server for tests, with
  `keytend-kmip-testing-X.Y.Z-sources.jar` and its SBOM,
  `keytend-kmip-testing-X.Y.Z-cyclonedx.json`, which lists the SDK and
  slf4j-api. They are not in the ZIPs. Use them in tests only.
- `keytend-kmip-X.Y.Z-central-bundle.zip`, the signed Maven artifacts exactly
  as they are uploaded to Maven Central. Users do not need it.
- A `.sha256` of each ZIP and of each of those four files.
- `SHA256SUMS`. It lists the SHA-256 of each file in the binary ZIP, under
  `keytend-kmip-X.Y.Z/`, then of the binary ZIP's own `SHA256SUMS`, then of the
  two ZIPs and the four files beside them. The binary ZIP's own `SHA256SUMS`
  lists its contents only.
- A `.asc` of each ZIP, of each of the four files and of `SHA256SUMS`:
  detached OpenPGP signatures by the release key.

Checksums show that a download is intact. Only the signatures show who
published it.

**Release key fingerprint:** `3A84912AFBE7D2B04EBA2A8A51E65DD49C6F987F`

The key's user ID is `keytend-kmip releases <releases@keytend.dev>`. It is
published on keys.openpgp.org and keyserver.ubuntu.com. A key with the right
name and a different fingerprint is not the release key.

Signatures are made by a signing subkey, so verify against the primary
fingerprint above, not the subkey's. A revoked subkey's signatures no longer
verify, so refresh the key before you verify
(`gpg --refresh-keys 3A84912AFBE7D2B04EBA2A8A51E65DD49C6F987F`).

To verify a release:

<!-- release-check: verify -->
```sh title="Verifying release artifacts"
gpg --keyserver keys.openpgp.org --recv-keys 3A84912AFBE7D2B04EBA2A8A51E65DD49C6F987F
# "Good signature", by this fingerprint:
gpg --verify keytend-kmip-X.Y.Z.zip.asc keytend-kmip-X.Y.Z.zip
gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc SHA256SUMS
sha256sum -c keytend-kmip-X.Y.Z.zip.sha256
unzip -q keytend-kmip-X.Y.Z.zip
sha256sum -c --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS   # the ZIP, its contents, and what else you downloaded
```

`SHA256SUMS` also lists the source ZIP and the in-memory server's three files.
`--ignore-missing` skips those you did not download (GNU coreutils 8.25 or later; on macOS,
`shasum -a 256 -c --ignore-missing SHA256SUMS`). Every line it prints must say
`OK`, and the binary ZIP and its JARs must be among them, so unzip in the same
directory first.

For the source ZIP alone, in the directory you downloaded it to:

<!-- release-check: verify-source -->
```sh frame="code"
gpg --verify keytend-kmip-X.Y.Z-src.zip.asc keytend-kmip-X.Y.Z-src.zip
sha256sum -c keytend-kmip-X.Y.Z-src.zip.sha256
unzip -q keytend-kmip-X.Y.Z-src.zip   # keytend-kmip-X.Y.Z-src/, which builds with ./mvnw
```

For the in-memory server alone, in the directory you downloaded it to:

<!-- release-check: verify-testing -->
```sh frame="code"
gpg --verify keytend-kmip-testing-X.Y.Z.jar.asc keytend-kmip-testing-X.Y.Z.jar
sha256sum -c keytend-kmip-testing-X.Y.Z.jar.sha256
```

keytend-kmip is not on Maven Central. A release deployed there would be the
same build: its JARs and SBOMs would have the SHA-256 values `SHA256SUMS`
lists.
