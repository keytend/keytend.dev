This page takes you from a source checkout to an application that seals records with a key held
in a KMIP server.

## Build and install

You need JDK 17 or later. keytend-kmip is not on Maven Central. Build 0.10.0-rc.1 from a clone of
this repository, or take the JARs from the GitHub release
([From the GitHub release](#from-the-github-release)). From the repository root:

```sh title="Build and install"
git checkout v0.10.0-rc.1
./mvnw install
```

This builds the SDK, runs its unit tests and installs `dev.keytend:keytend-kmip:0.10.0-rc.1` in
your local Maven repository, with the other modules (among them `keytend-kmip-testing`, the
in-memory server). The JAR is also at `sdk/target/keytend-kmip-0.10.0-rc.1.jar`. Add the dependency
to your project:

<!-- release-check: dependency -->
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>dev.keytend</groupId>
  <artifactId>keytend-kmip</artifactId>
  <version>0.10.0-rc.1</version>
</dependency>
```

At run time the SDK needs one library, the logging API slf4j-api. Maven brings it with the SDK.
Bind it to your logging ([Logging](/kmip-java/docs/production/#logging)). The JAR is the named module
`dev.keytend.kmip`, which requires `org.slf4j`. A modular application adds
`requires dev.keytend.kmip;`.

### From the GitHub release

Without a build from source, take the SDK from the release's ZIP. Download
`keytend-kmip-0.10.0-rc.1.zip`, verify and unpack it
([Verifying release artifacts](/kmip-java/docs/security/#verifying-release-artifacts)), and install its JAR in
your local Maven repository:

<!-- release-check: install-sdk -->
```sh title="From the GitHub release"
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=keytend-kmip-0.10.0-rc.1/lib/keytend-kmip-0.10.0-rc.1.jar \
  -DgroupId=dev.keytend -DartifactId=keytend-kmip -Dversion=0.10.0-rc.1 -Dpackaging=jar \
  -DgeneratePom=true
```

`-DgeneratePom=true` installs a POM without a parent. Without it, Maven installs the POM from
inside the JAR. Its parent, `keytend-kmip-parent`, is installed only by a build from source, so
every build that uses the SDK then fails. The generated POM lists no dependencies, so add
slf4j-api beside the SDK dependency above:

<!-- release-check: dependency -->
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
  <artifactId>slf4j-api</artifactId>
  <version>2.0.20</version>
</dependency>
```

In Gradle, `implementation(files("libs/keytend-kmip-0.10.0-rc.1.jar"))` and
`implementation("org.slf4j:slf4j-api:2.0.20")` do the same without installing anything. The ZIP's
`lib/` also holds the SDK's sources, Javadoc and SBOM.

## Try it without a server

`InMemoryKmipServer` is an in-memory KMIP server for tests and for trying the SDK out. It is in its
own artifact, `keytend-kmip-testing`, not in the SDK. It is not for production: it does not protect
what it stores. For this throwaway program only, add it beside `keytend-kmip` without a scope. In
an application, put it in test scope (`<scope>test</scope>`, or Gradle's `testImplementation`),
never on the run-time class path:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>dev.keytend</groupId>
  <artifactId>keytend-kmip-testing</artifactId>
  <version>0.10.0-rc.1</version>
</dependency>
```

In Gradle, with `mavenLocal()` among the repositories, because keytend-kmip is not on Maven
Central:

```kotlin
implementation("dev.keytend:keytend-kmip-testing:0.10.0-rc.1")
```

This program runs the quickstart with no KMS. Save it as `TryKeytend.java`:

```java
import dev.keytend.kmip.kms.*;
import dev.keytend.kmip.testing.InMemoryKmipServer;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;

class TryKeytend {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    byte[] orderJson = "{\"id\":1042,\"total\":\"19.99\"}".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
    try (Kms kms = InMemoryKmipServer.of(KmipVersion.V2_1).connect()) {
      kms.keys().createAes(256).named("orders-kek")
          .usages(KeyUsage.ENCRYPT, KeyUsage.DECRYPT)
          .findOrCreate();
      CurrentKey kek = kms.keys().current("orders-kek");
      byte[] orderId = "order-1042".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
      byte[] sealed = kek.seal(orderJson, orderId);
      byte[] opened = kek.open(sealed, orderId);
      System.out.println(new String(opened, StandardCharsets.UTF_8));
    }
  }
}
```

Run it with the JARs you built: the SDK, slf4j-api (in `sdk/target/lib/`) and the in-memory
server:

```sh title="Try it without a server"
cp='sdk/target/keytend-kmip-0.10.0-rc.1.jar:sdk/target/lib/*'
java -cp "$cp:testing/target/keytend-kmip-testing-0.10.0-rc.1.jar" TryKeytend.java
```

It prints `{"id":1042,"total":"19.99"}`, after SLF4J's note that no logging is bound. The
sections below explain each line and replace the in-memory server with a real KMS. For an
application's tests, see [Test without a server](#test-without-a-server).

## Connect to your KMS

A `Kms` is the connection to one key management server (KMS). Build its configuration from three
inputs:

- **Endpoints**: one or more `host:port` pairs. List several only when they are replicas of one
  KMS that share the same keys. The KMIP port is usually 5696.
- **Client identity**: the certificate and private key the server knows the application by.
- **Trust**: the CA certificates that the server's certificate must chain to. The SDK also checks
  the server's host name.

```java
import dev.keytend.kmip.kms.*;
import java.nio.file.Path;
import java.util.Arrays;

char[] password = System.getenv("KMS_CLIENT_PASSWORD").toCharArray();
KmsConfig config = KmsConfig.builder()
    .endpoints("kms1.example.com:5696", "kms2.example.com:5696")
    .clientIdentityKeyStore(Path.of("client.p12"), password)
    .trustPem(Path.of("ca.pem"))
    .build();
Arrays.fill(password, '\0');      // the builder keeps its own copy

try (Kms kms = Kms.connect(config)) {
  System.out.println("Connected with KMIP " + kms.version());
}
```

`client.p12` is a PKCS#12 file with exactly one private key and its certificate chain.
`KMS_CLIENT_PASSWORD` holds its password. The builder copies the password, so the example wipes
the array once `build()` returns. Each builder method that takes a file's password also takes a
`Supplier<char[]>`, asked at each read of the file, so that nothing keeps a copy.

Other identity and trust sources:

| Builder method | Use it for |
|---|---|
| `clientIdentityPem(chain, key)` | a PEM certificate chain and an unencrypted PEM key |
| `clientIdentityPem(chain, key, keyPassword)` | an encrypted PEM key |
| `clientIdentityKeyStore(file, password)` | a PKCS#12 or JKS key store with one private key, told from its contents |
| `clientIdentity(keyStore, password)` | a `KeyStore` you loaded |
| `trustStore(file, password)` | a JKS or PKCS#12 trust store file |
| `trustStore(keyStore)` | trusted CAs in a `KeyStore` |
| `trustSystemDefaults()` | the JDK's default trusted CAs |

`Kms.connect` negotiates the KMIP version before it returns. By default it accepts KMIP 1.4 to
2.1. For an older server, lower the floor with `minimumVersion(KmipVersion.V1_2)`. Features the
negotiated version lacks fail before anything is sent (see [KMIP versions](/kmip-java/docs/compatibility/#kmip-versions)).

A `Kms` is thread-safe and owns a bounded pool of connections per endpoint. Create one per
application and close it on shutdown. [Runtime configuration](/kmip-java/docs/production/) covers failover,
deadlines, reloading and renewing credentials, and readiness checks.

## Find or create a key

Create the application's key the first time it starts, and find it every time after that:

```java
KeyHandle kek = kms.keys().createAes(256).named("orders-kek")
    .usages(KeyUsage.ENCRYPT, KeyUsage.DECRYPT)
    .findOrCreate();
```

`findOrCreate` returns the Active key with that name. If there is none, it creates and activates
one. Call it once at startup and keep the result. `findOrCreateResult()` does the same and also
says how the key was obtained (`outcome()`), for a startup log. Calls that race through one
`Kms` get the same key. Instances that race in separate processes get the same key only on a
server that enforces unique names
([several instances](/kmip-java/docs/operating-keys/#startup-on-several-instances)).

To always make a new key, end the builder with `create()` instead. `createPreActive()` makes a
key that is not usable until you activate it. Add `refusingExistingName()` before either to
refuse a name another object has already, rather than make a second object with it.

Key pairs are found or created by name the same way:

```java
KeyPairHandle signer = kms.keys().createKeyPair(KeyPairSpec.ec(Curve.P_256))
    .named("manifest-signer", "manifest-signer-public")
    .privateUsages(KeyUsage.SIGN).publicUsages(KeyUsage.VERIFY)
    .findOrCreate();
```

Their `findOrCreateResult()` returns a `FindOrCreatePairResult`: the `pair()`, the same
`outcome()` values and the pairs it `created()`.

## Key names are not access control

:::caution[A key name is not access control]
A key name is not an access-control boundary. On a server where others may create keys, anyone
can create one with your name, and a lookup by name may find it.
:::

Where other identities can create keys on the same server:

- keep the key's handle or identifier, and decrypt with it;
- use a server that enforces unique names;
- or select keys by an attribute only you can set, such as a custom attribute or object group
  under the server's access control.

The server's access control decides who may use a key. Give each application its own identity,
with only the operations it needs ([what each consumer's credential needs](/kmip-java/docs/production/#what-each-consumers-credential-needs)).

## Seal and open a record

`kms.keys().current(name)` returns a `CurrentKey`. It follows the newest key with that name, so
code that seals through it keeps working after a rotation. Share one `CurrentKey` per name.

```java
CurrentKey kek = kms.keys().current("orders-kek");
byte[] orderId = "order-1042".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
byte[] sealed = kek.seal(orderJson, orderId);
byte[] opened = kek.open(sealed, orderId);
```

`orderJson` is the record to protect, as bytes.

- `seal` encrypts the record locally with AES-256-GCM under a fresh data key. The KMS key wraps
  that data key on the server, and the KMS key never leaves the KMS. The result is one byte array
  to store.
- `orderId` is the additional authenticated data. It binds the sealed record to its identity. A
  sealed record copied to another order fails to open.
- `open` takes the same `orderId`. It also opens records sealed under older keys of the key's
  [lineage](/kmip-java/docs/kms-design/#lineage-and-rotation), the keys that replaced one another.
- Sealing needs KMIP 1.4 or later.

[Envelope encryption](/kmip-java/docs/envelope-encryption/) covers streams, files and random-access chunks.
[Key lifecycle](/kmip-java/docs/operating-keys/) covers rotation and retirement.

## Handle failures

Every failure that the server or the network causes is an unchecked `KmsException`. Misuse throws
the usual JDK exceptions instead: `NullPointerException` and `IllegalArgumentException` for bad
arguments, and `IllegalStateException` for a closed `Kms`.

Catch the cases your application handles and let the rest propagate:

```java
try {
  byte[] opened = kek.open(sealed, orderId);
} catch (CryptographicFailureException e) {
  // e.kind() says which failure it was. AUTHENTICATION_FAILED: the record was modified, or
  // orderId is not the value it was sealed with. INVALID_CIPHERTEXT: the stored record was
  // rejected before anything was sent. UNCONFIRMED: the server gave a generic error, which can be
  // a server fault, so it does not prove the record was modified.
} catch (KeyMismatchException e) {
  // The record names a key outside this key's lineage, so this application did not seal it.
} catch (StateConflictException e) {
  // The record's key is Compromised or Destroyed.
} catch (PermissionDeniedException e) {
  // Fix the client identity or the key's access policy on the server.
} catch (TransientException e) {
  // The KMS is unreachable. The SDK already retried on the other endpoints.
}
```

`kek`, `sealed` and `orderId` are from the previous section.

Code that branches on the kind of failure can use `KmsException.category()` instead. A failure has
the same category on every KMIP version:

| Category | Raised as | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `RETRY` | `TransientException` | Repeat the call later. |
| `NOT_FOUND` | `NotFoundException` | The object does not exist. |
| `FIX_ACCESS` | `PermissionDeniedException` | Fix the credentials or the object's access policy. |
| `FIX_REQUEST` | `InvalidRequestException`, `UnsupportedException`, `KeyMismatchException` | Fix the request, the version or the key it names. |
| `STATE` | `StateConflictException`, `AlreadyExistsException` | The object's state, or an existing object, conflicts with the call. |
| `BAD_DATA` | `CryptographicFailureException`, and `KeyMismatchException` for a record that names a key outside the lineage | The data was modified, corrupted or misfiled. |
| `OUTCOME_UNKNOWN` | `OutcomeUnknownException` | Check the object's state before you repeat the call. |
| `PARTIAL` | `PartialCompletionException` | Resume as the exception says. |
| `SERVER` | `ServerFailureException`, `ProtocolViolationException`, and `CryptographicFailureException` of kind `UNCONFIRMED` | The server failed. Do not quarantine data for it. |

Two rules matter when you change keys:

- **Reads are retried on the next endpoint. Mutations are never re-sent.**
- **A mutation that fails in transit has an unknown outcome.** It raises
  `OutcomeUnknownException`. Check the object's state before you repeat the call
  ([deadlines and retries](/kmip-java/docs/production/#deadlines-and-retries)).

A call of several steps that stops half-way raises `PartialCompletionException`. It names the
objects it created, and the keys it deactivated or destroyed.

## Test without a server

Connect the code under test to `InMemoryKmipServer`. It answers KMIP requests in memory, and the
`Kms` reaches it in process instead of over TLS. It can also inject failures. Add
`keytend-kmip-testing` in test scope. Your application never needs it at run time:

<!-- release-check: dependency -->
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>dev.keytend</groupId>
  <artifactId>keytend-kmip-testing</artifactId>
  <version>0.10.0-rc.1</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

In Gradle:

```kotlin
testImplementation("dev.keytend:keytend-kmip-testing:0.10.0-rc.1")
```

A modular test adds `requires dev.keytend.kmip.testing;`. These JUnit Jupiter tests seal and open
a record, and check that a denied key is reported:

<!-- release-check: test -->
```java
import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;

import dev.keytend.kmip.kms.*;
import dev.keytend.kmip.testing.*;
import java.nio.charset.StandardCharsets;
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

class OrderSealingTest {
  @Test
  void opensWhatItSeals() {
    try (Kms kms = InMemoryKmipServer.of(KmipVersion.V2_1).connect()) {
      kms.keys().createAes(256).named("orders-kek")
          .usages(KeyUsage.ENCRYPT, KeyUsage.DECRYPT)
          .findOrCreate();
      CurrentKey kek = kms.keys().current("orders-kek");
      byte[] orderId = "order-1042".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
      byte[] orderJson = "{\"id\":1042}".getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
      assertArrayEquals(orderJson, kek.open(kek.seal(orderJson, orderId), orderId));
    }
  }

  @Test
  void reportsADeniedKey() {
    InMemoryKmipServer server = InMemoryKmipServer.of(KmipVersion.V2_1);
    try (Kms kms = server.connect()) {
      KeyHandle kek = kms.keys().createAes(256).named("orders-kek")
          .usages(KeyUsage.ENCRYPT, KeyUsage.DECRYPT)
          .findOrCreate();
      server.failNext(ServerOperation.GET_ATTRIBUTES, Fault.PERMISSION_DENIED);
      assertThrows(PermissionDeniedException.class, kek::attributes);
    }
  }
}
```

- `failNext` makes the next matching request fail as a real server or network would. `Fault`
  lists the failures: server refusals such as `NOT_FOUND` and `PERMISSION_DENIED`, and network
  faults such as `UNREACHABLE`, `REPLY_LOST`, `HANG` and `SLOW`.
- `server.state(id)`, `server.names(id)` and `server.violations()` inspect what the server holds
  and any malformed requests.
- `server.tlsListener()` builds a TLS listener for the server, to test your TLS settings
  ([Over TLS](/kmip-java/docs/in-memory-server/#over-tls)).
- [In-memory test server](/kmip-java/docs/in-memory-server/) lists how the server answers KMIP requests and what
  it does not support.
- `keytend-kmip-testing` is test support. It is outside the compatibility promises
  ([the testing package](/kmip-java/docs/compatibility/#the-testing-package)). Never give it real keys.

### The in-memory server from the GitHub release

Without a build from source, install the SDK from the release
([From the GitHub release](#from-the-github-release)), then take the in-memory server from there
too. `keytend-kmip-testing-0.10.0-rc.1.jar` is a separate asset beside the ZIP, not inside it.
Download it with its `.asc` and `.sha256` and verify it
([Verifying release artifacts](/kmip-java/docs/security/#verifying-release-artifacts)):

```sh title="The in-memory server from the GitHub release"
gpg --verify keytend-kmip-testing-0.10.0-rc.1.jar.asc keytend-kmip-testing-0.10.0-rc.1.jar
sha256sum -c keytend-kmip-testing-0.10.0-rc.1.jar.sha256
```

Then install it in your local Maven repository, again with a POM without a parent, and add the
test-scope dependency from [Test without a server](#test-without-a-server):

<!-- release-check: install-testing -->
```sh frame="code"
mvn install:install-file -Dfile=keytend-kmip-testing-0.10.0-rc.1.jar \
  -DgroupId=dev.keytend -DartifactId=keytend-kmip-testing -Dversion=0.10.0-rc.1 -Dpackaging=jar \
  -DgeneratePom=true
```

In Gradle, `testImplementation(files("libs/keytend-kmip-testing-0.10.0-rc.1.jar"))` adds the file
itself. Its sources (`keytend-kmip-testing-0.10.0-rc.1-sources.jar`) and SBOM are assets beside it.
