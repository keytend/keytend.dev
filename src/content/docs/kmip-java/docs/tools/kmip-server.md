`run-server.sh` starts [keytend-kmip-server](/kmip-server/docs/)
for every live tool in this repository. It runs one pinned container image with Podman. It is a
test tool, not a way to deploy the server.

## When to use it

The live tools call it for you:

- the [server probe](/kmip-java/docs/tools/server-probe/), also run by `tools/release-check.sh --server DOCKER-TAR`;
- the [generic interop run](/kmip-java/docs/integration/keytend-kmip-server/), also run by
  `tools/release-check.sh --server DOCKER-TAR`;
- the [benchmark](/kmip-java/docs/tools/bench/), with `--topologies live`, whose smoke run
  `tools/release-check.sh --server DOCKER-TAR` runs too;
- the live test of the
  [Cassandra commit log and hints encryption](/kmip-java/docs/integration/cassandra-trunk-tde/).

Run it yourself to load the pinned image on a new machine, or to start a throwaway server for
your own tests.

## Requirements

- Linux on amd64, with Podman. The script uses Podman's `--userns keep-id`.
- `python3`, to wait until the server is ready.
- To get the image: the GitHub CLI `gh`, `sha256sum`, `tar` and `cmp`.
- Optional: `gpg` and `cosign`, to verify the release's signatures.

## Build and run

Load the pinned image once. Run this block from the repository root.

```sh title="Build and run"
repo_dir=$PWD
gh release download v0.10.0-rc.1 -R keytend/keytend-kmip-server -D /tmp/kts
(
  set -e
  cd /tmp/kts
  sha256sum -c keytend-kmip-server-0.10.0-rc.1-signed-release.tar.sha256
  tar -xf keytend-kmip-server-0.10.0-rc.1-signed-release.tar
  cmp SHA256SUMS release/SHA256SUMS
  cd release && sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS
)
# Optional: verify the signatures (needs gpg and cosign)
(cd /tmp/kts && gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.asc SHA256SUMS && \
  cosign verify-blob --key cosign.pub --insecure-ignore-tlog=true \
  --bundle SHA256SUMS.sigstore.json SHA256SUMS)
"$repo_dir/tools/kmip-server/run-server.sh" image \
  /tmp/kts/release/linux-amd64/keytend-kmip-server-0.10.0-rc.1.docker.tar
```

The optional step checks `SHA256SUMS` twice:

- `gpg` checks its OpenPGP signature. It must be a good signature by the keytend release key,
  primary fingerprint `3A84912AFBE7D2B04EBA2A8A51E65DD49C6F987F`. Import the key first, as
  [SECURITY.md](/kmip-java/docs/security/#verifying-release-artifacts) shows.
- `cosign` checks the Sigstore bundle against the `cosign.pub` in the same download, without the
  Rekor transparency log (`--insecure-ignore-tlog=true`). It shows that the files are
  consistent, not who published them.

The check that matters is the last command. `run-server.sh image` refuses an archive whose
SHA-256 is not the `archive_sha256` pinned in `pinned-image.properties`. It loads the archive,
then checks the loaded image's ID and prints it. Without an argument, it checks the image that is
already loaded.

Then start a server on a store directory you own. `pki_dir` is your directory with
`server.pem`, `server.key`, `ca.pem` and `policy.json`. The first command adds `master.key`.

```sh frame="code"
pki_dir=/path/to/pki
tools/kmip-server/run-server.sh master-key "$pki_dir/master.key"
mkdir -p /tmp/kts-store
tools/kmip-server/run-server.sh start kts-1 --data /tmp/kts-store --pki "$pki_dir" \
  -- --experimental-v3
tools/kmip-server/run-server.sh stop kts-1
```

`start` waits until `/readyz` answers 200, then prints `port=P health=P`.

### Commands

```text
run-server.sh image [DOCKER-TAR|IMAGE]   verify (and load) the image; print its ID
run-server.sh version                    the image's --version
run-server.sh master-key FILE            a new master key (the image's generate-master-key)
run-server.sh start NAME --data DIR (--pki DIR | --cert F --key F --ca F --policy F --master-key F)
    [--users F] [--validation-ca F] [--provisioning-ca F --provisioning-ca-key F]
    [--port P] [--health-port P] [--log FILE] [-- SERVE-OPTION...]
run-server.sh stop NAME...               SIGTERM, SIGKILL after 2 s; wait until removed
run-server.sh kill NAME...               SIGKILL at once (an outage); wait until removed
run-server.sh running NAME               exit 0 if running
run-server.sh cleanup PREFIX             remove every container of this helper named PREFIX*
```

`image` exits 0 for the pinned image and 10 for another image allowed by
`KEYTEND_SERVER_UNPINNED=1`. Any other non-zero exit is a refusal or a failure.

### What `start` runs

`start` runs the image's `serve` with `podman run --rm`:

- The server certificate, key, client CA, policy and master key are each mounted read-only.
  `--users`, `--validation-ca`, and `--provisioning-ca` with `--provisioning-ca-key` (the two go
  together) mount and pass those files too. No other PKI file enters the container. The server
  takes a provisioning CA only when its certificate is also in the `--ca` bundle.
- The store is `kmip.sqlite` in `--data DIR`, which must exist. The container runs as UID
  10001, mapped to you, so you own the store and can read it.
- The root file system is read-only, with a 64 MiB `/tmp`. The container has no capabilities
  and `no-new-privileges`.
- KMIP (5696) and health (8080) listen on `127.0.0.1`, on the given host ports or on free ones.
- The `SERVE-OPTION`s after `--` follow, such as `--experimental-v3` or `--max-lease-seconds N`.
- Every `KMIP_*` variable of your environment reaches the server, such as
  `KMIP_LEASE_STATES=active`.
- The container's output is appended to `--log`, by default `DIR/server-NAME.log`.

A stopped, killed or crashed container is removed, but its store stays. `start` again on the
same `--data` and ports recovers the same server. The tools `cleanup` their own prefix on exit,
so nothing is left running after a failure.

## Configuration

[`pinned-image.properties`](https://github.com/keytend/keytend-kmip-java/blob/c6c8eb9febaf9fd7da7fd2328d6879dda23aa968/tools/kmip-server/pinned-image.properties) names one build: keytend-kmip-server
0.10.0-rc.1, its linux/amd64 Docker archive by SHA-256, and the image that archive loads by ID.
`run-server.sh` starts only that image ID. It loads an archive only if its SHA-256 matches.

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `KEYTEND_SERVER_IMAGE` | the pin's `image` | the image ID or reference to run |
| `KEYTEND_SERVER_UNPINNED` | unset | `1` runs an image that is not the pin, with a warning |
| `PODMAN` | `podman` | the container command |
| `KMIP_*` | none | passed to the server unchanged |

`tools/release-check.sh` records a run with `--server-unpinned` as `UNPIN`, never as a pass.

## Limits

- Only one server can use a store at a time. The server locks its store, and a second container
  given the same `--data` exits at startup (`the store is in use by a running server`). Start it
  only once the first is down. The server's own documentation says more replicas are not a
  high-availability configuration.
- Stores written by early development builds of the server do not open (`invalid master key`). Every tool makes a fresh store per run.
- The pin covers one platform, linux/amd64.
